Usage: Drag another .net assembly onto SystemLoggingTrick.exe and watch it fill up the logfile.

Description:

This project allows you to capture literally ALL activity happening in the System.Net class

You can capture activity of your own assembly or even let it load an external assembly. (Assembly.Load)

The logfile that results from this will contain EVERYTHING you could ever need.

Ths project could be used for malware analysis (even when the sample is heavily obfuscated).
